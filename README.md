# IPL 2023 Data Analysis 🏏📊  

## Overview  
This is **not a project**, but rather a self-interest initiative to apply what I recently learned through a **data science course** and to explore **new concepts**. Through this small effort, I have gained hands-on experience with **Jupyter notebooks, Python libraries**, and various data visualization techniques.  

## About This Notebook  
- This notebook contains **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **IPL 2023 season**, analyzing **team performances, player statistics, and match insights**.  
- Various **Python libraries** such as **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy** have been used for data manipulation and visualization.  
- The analysis includes **team-wise and player-wise insights**, **match trends**, **scoring patterns**, and more. 

## Key Learnings 📚  
✔️ How to **work with Jupyter Notebooks**  
✔️ Using **Pandas for data manipulation**  
✔️ Creating **visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn**  
✔️ Understanding **different data types and structures**  
✔️ Generating **match insights through EDA**  

## Disclaimer ❗  
- This is **not an accurate or professional analysis** and may contain **inaccuracies**.  
- Two matches were missing in the dataset, so some insights might be **incomplete or incorrect**.  
- The data used here may not be **100% reliable**, and the purpose was **learning and experimentation** rather than drawing final conclusions.

## Data Cleaning Process 🛠️  
Before performing any analysis, the dataset was **cleaned and preprocessed** to ensure a smoother workflow:  
✔️ **Handling Missing Values** – Removed unnecessary columns and dealt with missing or inconsistent data.  
✔️ **Filtering Relevant Data** – Extracted key match details such as **batting stats, wickets, extras, and over-wise progression**.  
✔️ **Standardizing Team & Player Names** – Ensured uniformity in naming conventions for teams and players.  
✔️ **Derived Columns** – Created additional metrics for **cumulative runs, strike rates, and match progression analysis**. 

## Visualizations Included 📊  
🔹 **Number of Matches per Season**  
🔹 **Matches Played at Each Venue**  
🔹 **Matches Played by Each Team**  
🔹 **Team vs Team Runs Comparison (Heatmap)**  
🔹 **Top Run Scorers & Top Wicket Takers**  
🔹 **Most Sixes and Fours by Batsmen**  
🔹 **Top Individual Match Scores**  
🔹 **Total Runs Scored by Each Team**  
🔹 **Wicket Types Distribution (Pie Chart)**  
🔹 **Match 13 Worm Graph (Rinku Singh’s Last Over Heroics)**  

## Conclusion  
This exploration was **not about building a perfect dataset** but rather an effort to **apply new learnings and understand the workflow** of a data analysis project. **I now have a better understanding of Python, data visualization, and working with real-world sports datasets.**
